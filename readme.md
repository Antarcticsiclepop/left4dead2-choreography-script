> [Subscribe](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2382842747) to the workshop item to starting writing dialogue scripts for your custom levels.

> You'll need to add this addon as **required workshop item** for your dialogues to work on your custom levels!

# Creating your dialogue script

Create a new `.nut` file under the `scripts` folder, I recommend using a similiar name as your custom level and suffix it with *_choreo*.

Import the choreographic script at the beginning of your script file:

```javascript
IncludeScript("wolphin_choreography");
```

# Loading your dialogue script in your custom level

To load your dialogue script to your level, add the following outputs to a `info_gamemode` entity:

```
My output named                 OnCoopPostIO
Target entities named           @director
Via this input                  RunScriptFile
With a parameter override of    example_choreo
```

```
My output named                 OnVersusPostIO
Target entities named           @director
Via this input                  RunScriptFile
With a parameter override of    example_choreo
```

# How to trigger a **cue**

There are many ways to trigger a **cue**, but a *remarkable* **cue** can only be triggered by *remarkable entities*:

## **By *func_orator* entity**

Use a entity with the following output:

```
My output named                 <any>
Target entities named           func_orator
Via this input                  SpeakResponseConcept
With a parameter override of    <concept_name>
```

## **By *info_director* entity**

Use a entity with the following output (only targets survivors):

```
My output named                 <any>
Target entities named           info_director
Via this input                  FireConceptToAny
With a parameter override of    <concept_name>
```

## **By interactable entity**

Use a interable entity (ex. `func_button`) with the following output:

```
My output named                 OnPressed
Target entities named           !activator
Via this input                  SpeakResponseConcept
With a parameter override of    <concept_name>
```

## **By *ent_fire* command**

Write a script that executes the following function:

```
EntFire("info_director", "FireConceptToAny", "<concept_name>", 0.0);
EntFire("func_orator", "SpeakResponseConcept", "<concept_name>", 0.0);
```

## **By *info_remarkable* entity**

Create a `info_remarkable` with the following property:

```
Subject context                 <concept_name>
```

# Helpful tips

## **How to reload your dialogue script in-game by command**

```
script_execute example_choreo
```

## **How to trigger a concept from console**

For **concepts** targeting survivors (you will not be able to prompt **cues** for the survivor you are in control):
```
ent_fire info_director FireConceptToAny <concept_name>
```

To trigger a **concept** for the current survivor you are in control:
```
ent_fire !self SpeakResponseConcept <concept_name>
```

For **concepts** targeting orator entities:
```
ent_fire func_orator SpeakResponseConcept <concept_name>
```

## **Use the game's subtitle files to find scenes**

You can use the subtitle files of the game to find scenes you are looking for and ones you've never seen before, subtitle identifiers for survivors are written as `<survivor_name>_<scene_name>`, for npcs the subtitle identifier is the entire scene name. Example:

```javascript
"Coach_WorldC4M208"	"<clr:112,75,125>Coach: Dang. Bitches must like sugar." // "WorldC4M208" is the scene name
"Virgil_C4End14"	"<clr:148,148,110>Virgil: Woo, look out now, that big fella, there!" // "Virgil_C4End14" is the scene name
```

## **Trigger sounds as responses**

By using the `Response::callback()` or `Cue::callback()` function you can play sounds, example:

### **`WCScript::emitSound()`**

```javascript
.responses(
    Response()
        .callback(@(speaker, query) emitSound(speaker, query, "Boat.Horn"))
)
```

```javascript
/**
* @param {instance} SPEAKER The actor of the response
* @param {table} QUERY The context table
* @param {string} SOUND_NAME The name of the sound
*/
emitSound(SPEAKER, QUERY, SOUND_NAME)
```

### **`WCScript::playSoundFile()`**

```javascript
.responses(
    Response()
        .callback(@(speaker, query) playSoundFile(speaker, query, "music/bacteria/boomerbacteria.wav", 1.0))
)
```

> Use the `/` character for file path.

```javascript
/**
* @param {instance} SPEAKER The actor of the response
* @param {table} QUERY The context table
* @param {string} SOUND_FILE The sound file to play
* @param {number} [VOLUME = 1] Volume to play the audio file (0.0 - 1.0)
*/
playSoundFile(SPEAKER, QUERY, SOUND_FILE, VOLUME)
```

## **Replacing existing cues**

You can override existing **cues** with your own dialogues, this includes the radial menu, example:

```
// Replace the `Argh!` response in the radial menu for **Nick**
Concept()
    .value("PlayerNegative")
    .publishCues(
        Cue()
            .actor("gambler")
            .responses(
                "Grenade04" // Fire coming!
            )
    )
```

## **Apply context to world**

You can create your own **context** in the **world's context table** to use as **criterias**, example:

### **`WCScript::setWorldContext()`**

Function to create a **context** in the **world's context table**.

```javascript
.responses(
    Response()
        .callback(@(speaker, query) setWorldContext("MyContext"))
)
```

> Your **context** will be prefixed with the word *"world"* when saving to the **world's context table**, *"MyContext"* will appear as *"worldMyContext"*.

```javascript
/**
* @param {string} CONTEXT A context
* @param {number | string} [VALUE = 1] The context value
* @param {number} [DURATION = -1] Duration in seconds for the context to exist, -1 to exist forever
*/
setWorldContext(CONTEXT, VALUE, DURATION)
```

### **`WCScript::addToWorldContext()`**

Function to keep increasing the value of your **context**, it will create the **context** if it doesn't exist with the additive value.

```javascript
.responses(
    Response()
        .callback(@(speaker, query) addToWorldContext(query, "MyContext"))
)
```

```javascript
/**
* @param {table} QUERY The context table
* @param {string} CONTEXT A context
* @param {number | string} [VALUE = 1] The additive value
* @param {number} [DURATION = -1] Duration in seconds for the context to exist, -1 to exist forever
*/
addToWorldContext(CONTEXT, VALUE, DURATION)
```
