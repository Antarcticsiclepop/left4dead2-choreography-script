# Writing a `Cue::` object

```javascript
.publishCues(
    Cue()
        .orator("gambler")
        .responses(
            ...
        )
);
```

This is an example of a `Cue::` object with the orator *gambler* (a.k.a. Nick), a `Cue::` object must contain one or more **responses**. A single **response** will be prompted at random if the `Cue::` object's **criterias** are met. By default, the orator must be alive as a criteria.

The list of survivors names are as follows:

```javascript
"coach", "gambler", "producer", "mechanic", "biker", "manager", "namvet", "teengirl"
```

## **`::criterias()`**

Using this function will define criterias the **cue** must meet for the **responses** to prompt. Example:

```javascript
.publishCues(
    Cue()
        .orator("gambler")
        .criteras(
            criteriaNotInDanger()
        )
        ...
);
```

## **`::followup()`**

Using this function will trigger another **concept** after is has successfully prompted any of its **responses**. Example:

```javascript
.publishCues(
    Cue()
        .orator("gambler")
        .followup("SomeNextConcept")
        ...
);
```

## **Known bugs**

There is a bug where **cues** with more criterias will have higher priority when evaluating, it's recommended to keep the same amount of criteras for all `Cue::` objects.
